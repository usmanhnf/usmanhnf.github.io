I regularly teach courses related to Mechanics, Finite Element Procedures and Reinforced Concrete Design. These are the courses which I have been teaching during my teaching career. I will be migrating the compiled course material for the courses here as soon as I find time from my research.

#### Undergraduate Courses

* Engineering Mechanics (ME-107)
* Mechanics of Solid - I (CE-103)
* Mechanics of Solid - II (CE-205)
* Plain and Reinforced Concrete - II (CE-310)



#### Graduate Courses
* Advanced Structural Mechanics (CE-800)
* Advanced Concrete Design (CE-805)
* Research Methodology (RM-898)
