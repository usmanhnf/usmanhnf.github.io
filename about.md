## About

I have recently joined, the Insitute of Technology and Innovation at the University of Southern Denmark (August 2024) as assistant professor. I will be teaching as well as conducting research. My research will be, of course, focused on understanding the damage mechanisms in concrete and using this understanding to develop damage assessment techniques. However, I will be bringing in the knowledge from sustainability and circularity in construction.

I have some research work left from my postdoctoral research in which I am applying the recently developed source location techniques on reinforced concrete beams. I am also glad to have developed a collaboration with Professor Seo, Soo-Yeon from Hybrid Structures Lab at KNUT, South Korea, for future research in aocustic emission, fiber optic sensing and computer vision technology. My recent publications can be found at this link
