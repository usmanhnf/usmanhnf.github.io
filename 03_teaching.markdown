      <p><code>update</code> I am currently teaching the undergraduate course of <em> Finite Element Analysis</em>. I am documenting the course material and I am planning to compile it in the form of lecture notes on my website.</p>
      <p>In Fall 2024, I taught the course of <em>Advanced Finite Element Analysis</em>.</p>
      <p>In the past, I regularly taught courses related to Mechanics, Finite Element Procedures and Reinforced Concrete Design. These are the courses which I have been teaching during my teaching career. I will be migrating the compiled course material for the courses here as soon as I find time from my research.</p>
